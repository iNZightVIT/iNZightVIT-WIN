Package: RCurl
Version: 1.95-4.13
Title: General Network (HTTP/FTP/...) Client Interface for R
Author: Duncan Temple Lang and the CRAN team
SystemRequirements: GNU make, libcurl
Maintainer: Duncan Temple Lang <duncan@r-project.org>
Description: A wrapper for 'libcurl' <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/>
	Provides functions to allow one to compose general HTTP requests
        and provides convenient functions to fetch URIs, get & post
        forms, etc. and process the results returned by the Web server.
        This provides a great deal of control over the HTTP/FTP/...
        connection and the form of the request while providing a
        higher-level interface than is available just using R socket
        connections.  Additionally, the underlying implementation is
        robust and extensive, supporting FTP/FTPS/TFTP (uploads and
        downloads), SSL/HTTPS, telnet, dict, ldap, and also supports
        cookies, redirects, authentication, etc.
