Description: Wrapper functions providing a simple, limited interface to
    more complex functions and code snippets. In many cases, the result
    includes a code attribute containing the 'tidyverse' R code used
    to obtain the result. iNZightTools also contains a set of helper
    functions used by other 'iNZight' packages (including itself).
